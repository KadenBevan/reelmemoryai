Improved Query Prompt
Analyze the user's query for semantic search enhancement: "${query}". Extract and expand the analysis for the following fields while ensuring the enhanced output is strictly aligned with the original query's intent.

Main Search Terms:
Extract the central intent of the query, preserving its semantic core.
Expand terms using direct synonyms, related keywords, and alternate phrasing tied specifically to the original request.
Avoid generalizing beyond the scope of the user’s explicit query.
Visual Elements:
Identify tangible objects, scenes, or contextual imagery closely aligned with the original query's domain.
For recipe-related queries, specify possible food, drink, ingredients, and preparation tools.
Ensure listed elements are directly relevant to the original query.
Temporal Context:
Determine whether the query implies a specific time or season (e.g., seasonal recipes, traditional methods).
State whether the context is modern, historical, or otherwise time-dependent.
Relevant Topics or Themes:
Expand on broader topics directly related to the query’s intent.
Include only those subtopics that add meaningful depth to the original user intent without deviating into unrelated areas.

Output Requirements

  "searchTerms": ["term1", "term2", "..."],
  "visualElements": ["element1", "element2", "..."],
  "temporalContext": {
    "timeframe": "Relevant timeframe if applicable to the query",
    "recency": "Whether the query applies to current, past, or timeless contexts"
  },
  "topics": ["topic1", "topic2", "..."]
}
